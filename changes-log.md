   - Added appointment booking functionality

3. **Salesmen**:
   - Increased from 5 to 7 salesmen in the database
   - Implemented linking of appointments to salesmen in a round-robin fashion based on priority

## Admin Section Changes

1. **Admin.js**:
   - Added `formatNeo4jDate` function (currently unused, marked by ESLint)
   - Added salesman management functionality:
     - Creating new salesmen with fields: name, email, phone, and priority
     - GET endpoint to retrieve all salesmen ordered by priority
     - DELETE endpoint to delete salesmen (with checks for linked appointments)
     - POST endpoint for managing salesman availability at `/api/salesmen/:id/availability`

2. **Salesmen Appointments Management**:
   - Added `initializeSalesmanAppointments` function that checks for unlinked appointments and assigns them to salesmen
   - Implemented a round-robin approach based on salesman priority for appointment allocation
   - Added API endpoints for retrieving appointments for salesmen

3. **Form Field Changes**:
   - Removed timeline and lotStatus fields from the lead form
   - Updated validation to only require: name, email, phone, state, squareFootage, and financingStatus
   - Added better error handling for API connections

4. **Bug Fixes**:
   - Fixed duplicate export in PhotoGallery.js
   - Fixed scrolling issues in the form UI to make the submit button accessible
   - Implemented error handling for cases when Neo4j database is not accessible

## API Endpoints

1. **Salesmen Endpoints**:
   - GET `/api/salesmen` - Retrieves all salesmen ordered by priority
   - POST `/api/salesmen` - Creates a new salesman (requires name, email, phone, priority)
   - DELETE `/api/salesmen/:id` - Deletes a salesman (if they have no linked appointments)
   - POST `/api/salesmen/:id/availability` - Updates salesman availability

2. **Appointment Endpoints**:
   - GET `/api/appointments` - Retrieves appointments (can be filtered by status)
   - POST `/api/appointments` - Creates a new appointment
   - Additional functionality for retrieving appointments by salesman ID is needed

## Future Improvements

1. **Salesman Utilities**:
   - Need to implement `getSalesmanAppointments` function to fetch appointments for a specific salesman
   - Need to implement `getSalesmanAvailableAppointments` to fetch only available appointments
   - Need to implement `getSalesmanBookedAppointments` to fetch only booked appointments
   - Need to implement `getSalesmanAppointmentsByDate` to fetch appointments for a specific date

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Improved handling of Neo4j connection issues (currently falls back to in-memory storage)
   - Better validation and error messages for appointment booking

3. **UI Improvements**:
   - Form layout and accessibility issues should be addressed
   - Proper scrolling for long forms
